    <h5>Wednesday May 8 2024</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>This was unexpected.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>When I opened up a couple sections of the fence I wanted \
    to get more wildlife coming into the yard. I didn't think about \
    geese though. It's kind of nice that they found their way in and \
    grazed for a bit. This happened a few times that I saw.</p>\
    <br>\
    <br>\
    <p>It's kind of hard to see in the pictures, but each of them has \
    a gosling with it.</p>\

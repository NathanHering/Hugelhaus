    <p>This is a litteral uphill battle.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>The yard has a real problem with how rough the ground is. \
    As I get more into discovering the cause it becomes obvious \
    that there are a lot of voles. I'm really not sure what to do \
    long term, but this first step is to just fill in the worst of \
    the vole runways.</p>\

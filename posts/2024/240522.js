    <h1>East Fence Clearing 2</h1>\
    <h5>Wednesday May 22 2024</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>And now the work begins.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I finally decided to order a truck load of top soil and \
    begin filling in the rough ground along the fence. After clearing \
    out the trees, the ground was too rough to possibly plant grass \
    and mow.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Here the top soil is being delivered. Of course it started raining \
    very hard the moment it was piled in my driveway. I had to rush out and \
    buy a larger tarp that could cover it all.</p>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_240522a}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>One load at a time I dump soil on the worst section of this side of \
    the fence. Here, closest to the end of the yard was really rough.</p>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_240522b}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>You can get an idea of how much we had to remove along the whole \
    fence. It was quite a bit. In some places it was around four feet deep from \
    the fence.</p>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_240522c}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>I only planted grass by a small section of the fence to start. The \
    sapplings we cut are pretty determined to grow back so I may need some \
    time to kill them off before planting grass.</p>\

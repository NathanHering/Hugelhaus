    <p>It does the job nicely.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Previously there was a portable AC unit, the kind on wheels with a \
    ventilation tube that could be attached to a window. It wasn't really \
    powerful enough to handle the kitchen and livingroom.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I forgot to take pictures of the process, but I installed this new \
    one and needed to build a special attachment to make it fit in the \
    window. It wasn't quite wide enough. And I wanted to add extra insullation. \
    So, there's a wood panel on the front that holds some fiberglass between \
    it and the factory made window fitting.</p>\

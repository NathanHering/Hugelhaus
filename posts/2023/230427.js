    <p>The latest additions to the Lego kit collection.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>The lego collection display in the livingroom has a couple new
    additions. These are the last ones I'll be displaying on these shelves
    though. I'm planning on removing these shelves and putting in something
    for the cats instead; like a climbing wall and perch where they can
    see the room from up high.</p>\

    <h1>NE Corner Fence Removal</h1>\
    <h5>Wednesday September 14 2023</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>I'll have to clear out some brush first.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>The idea is to give access to the yard for the animals \
    in the area. Mostly deer and turkey from what I've seen so \
    far. Removing a section of fence at either corner should \
    help make it easier for them.</p>\

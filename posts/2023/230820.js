    <h1>Fallen Oak Tree Removal</h1>\
    <h5>May - August 2023</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>A tree that was laying there for years became months of work.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I don't know how long this tree was laying there. My best guess would be that it
    had been there for at least six years based on the growth that was around it. This 
    was the biggest mess in the yard to clean up. For the most part all the other clean
    up work was pretty much done.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>That leaves a couple tons of fallen oak as the last big clean up project. They had
    cut it up for the most part. But plenty of the tree wasn't completely cut into logs.
    My brother came over and used his chainsaw to get the big part of the trunk cut up.
    There was still some cutting to do, since it was kind of sunk in the ground and my
    brother, understandably, didn't want to plung his chainsaw bar into the dirt.</p>\
    <br>\
    <h2>May</h2>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_230820a}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>Most of the work in June was cleaning up the upper branches and some of the trunk.
    Fire was the tool of choice to dispose of it quickly. This required the least amount
    of moving heavy wood.</p>\
    <br>\
    <h2>June</h2>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_230820b}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>Now that the branches and small parts of the trunk are gone, this leaves the most
    difficult part. The trunk was about 30" in diameter and was sunken into the ground.
    This means that I'd have to come up with a method of moving that kind of weight out
    of the rut it had been sinking into. I opted for a car tire jack and a few hours of 
    cranking it out of where it was resting. Then I was able to finish cutting into pieces
    that could then be stacked and burned.</p>\
    <br>\
    <h2>July</h2>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_230820c}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>After all the burning and clean up, there were bare dirt patches. So, I planted some
    grass and let it fill out for a afew weeks. It looks pretty much cleaned up from the
    picture, but there are still some annoying ruts left behind. That'll have to be something
    I take care of another time.</p>\

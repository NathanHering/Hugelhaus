    <h1>Beaver Work</h1>\
    <h5>Wednesday October 18 2023</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>Next to humans, beavers change their environment the most.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>After having removed a section of the fence nearest the wetlands \
    where I knew there is a beaver damn, they starting collecting trees \
    from my yard. I hadn't really expected that since there's a lot of \
    trees on the other side of the fence closer to their damn. It seems \
    that Willow is a favorite of theirs though.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>They took about six Willow of various ages. They also took a Birtch \
    a little further up the yard.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Once they got started, I didn't do anything to stop them from taking \
    more. I figured I'll see what they leave me with and address it next \
    year.</p>\

    <h1>Back Yard Update</h1>\
    <h5>Wednesday October 18 2023</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>Intro</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Here are the tasks I had on my list for the previous year.</p>\
    <br>\
    <ul>\
    <li>Remove the white fence by the garage. (from first year's list)</li><br>\
    <li>Take down the satelite dishes. (from first year's list)</li><br>\
    <li>Continue clearing out the weeds from around the trees at the north end of the \
    yard. I may leave only the trees I intend to harvest cuttings from.</li><br>\
    <li>Clear out the brush and weeds along the north fence and possibly the east and \
    west too.</li><br>\
    <li>I'm considering mulching along the north fence like I did with the septic tank lids.</li><br>\
    <li>Mulch around the leach field lids in the front yard.</li><br>\
    <li>Possibly build a decorative wooden fence by the leach field lids.</li><br>\
    <li>Start growing ground cover around the septic tank lids.</li><br>\
    <li>Clear out the growth around the fence at the south of the yard and mulch.</li><br>\
    </ul>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_231018}'></div>\
    <br>\
    <br>\
    <p>Here's what I have in mind for next year.</p>\
    <br>\
    <ul>\
    <li>Finish clearing along the east fence so I can mow right up to the fence.</li><br>\
    <li>Clean up all the fallen trees that the beavers took down. (spoiler alert, they took down a bunch)</li><br>\
    <li>Remove the strawberry planter and plant grass.</li><br>\
    <li>Fill in as many ruts and holes in the yard as I can manage.</li><br>\
    <li>Do something with the pile of logs next to the burn pile. Cut and split them maybe? Then pile them neater? Not sure.</li><br>\
    </ul>\
    <br>\
    <p>The list may be short, but that's a lot of work I just listed.</p>\
    <br>\

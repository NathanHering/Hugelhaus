    <p>Henry's final days.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I think it was on a Thursday that I notice Henry stumbling
    as he walked down the hall. For a cat, that's a really bad sign.
    I took him to the vet and they found his chest cavity was filling
    with fluid. It wasn't his lungs and it wasn't very extreme, but
    he was having a hard time breathing.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>They emptied the fluid and gave me medicine to administer to
    him. This helped for about seven or so weeks, but we knew already
    that this wouldn't improve and was a miserable existence for him.</p>\
    <br>\

    <br>\
    <p>My son came to live with me mid December and a few days later
    we took him to be euthanized.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Henry was found walking out of the woods behind my parents house
    many years earlier. My dad took care of him and Henry lived with them
    untill my dad passed away. After that, I adopted him and he lived with
    June and I.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>No one is certain how old he was, but the best guess was from my 
    niece who thought he was probably around 14-15 years old by the time
    he passed away.</p>\

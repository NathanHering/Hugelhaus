    <p>Learning how to grow a lot of mint from seed.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I'm planning on growing a lot of ground cover plants in the yard. I'm hoping \
    this will make it easier to maintain the yard since I'll be able to mow up to the \
    ground cover plants and won't need to use a string trimmer as much. I think mint \
    will be one of the plants I use as ground cover. It would smell nice and minty \
    fresh after every time I mow.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>That being the case, I figured I should try to grow mint from seed so I'm not \
    buying as much and can yield a lot more quickly. However, I've heard it's not very \
    easy to grow mint from seed. I guess I'm about to find out.</p>\

    <p>I watched them and made sure they had moisture in the soil but not even one \
    sprouted. Oh well, maybe I'll try again. I think the problem was the temperature \
    wasn't warm enough where I had them. I need a place where I can keep the cats from \
    getting into them, but I can also regulate the temperature.</p>\

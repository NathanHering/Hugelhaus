    <h1>Watching Paint Dry</h1>\
    <h5>Saturday August 13 2023</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>Another mess to clean up from the former owners.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>In the process of removing the half finished and mostly damaged\
    walls in the basement, I uncovered about 15 one gallon cans and a\
    5 gallon buckets of very old paint. None of it was worth saving, but\
    disposing of it is a process. You can't, or at least aren't supposed\
    to just throw it in the garbage. So, I went about it the prescribed\
    fashion; dry it out before throwing it away.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>The idea is to dry out the paint if it's water based, which this\
    paint was. Since there was so much of it, this took quite a while. I\
    laid out a sheet of plastic and poured some paint down. Then I sprinkeled\
    wood shavings over it to help increase surface area.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I had to repeat this process several times and it ended up taking over a\
    month to dry all of it out so it could be thrown away.</p>\

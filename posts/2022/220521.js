    <h1>Fallen Tree</h1>\
    <h5>Saturday May 21 2022</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>If a tree falls in your yard and no one is around to hear it, can it crush your fence?</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I had been looking forward to a storm that had been in the forecast. It was a warm Saturday \
    and I was hoping I could get a chance to enjoy the thunder, lightning, and the feel of the \
    temperature drop just before it started raining. Which I did, I sat out on the deck and watched \
    the sky get dark and the clouds light up.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I sat for a while and the rain didn't come. I thought maybe the downpour had just missed me. \
    I went back inside and not long after I heard the sound of pelting rain on the roof. I stoped what \
    I was doing to watch.</p>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_220521a}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>After the spectacle of the storm having been enjoyed I went about the rest of my evening and got \
    some sleep. The next morning I got a call from my neighbor asking me if I had noticed what the storm \
    had left behind. This brings me back to the metaphysical conundrum raised by the subtitle of this \
    post.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>As it turns out, a tree can in fact crush your fence, even if no one hears it.</p>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_220521b}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>I called my insurance company and had them send somone out to look at the damage. I didn't expect \
    them to cover the damage to the fence. But I wanted it on the record in case some damage had been \
    done to the septic system. The top of the tree landed on the leach field. The fence was basically \
    worthless, but the septic system is an expensive thing to have repaired. I'll need the tree cleared \
    away before I can get a better picture.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>The fallen tree wasn't just big but also dangerous. There were large branches of other trees broken \
    in the path of the fall. Some of them were hanging precariously. I had to consider hiring a tree service \
    company to come take care of it.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Honestly, it wasn't much of a choice. It was a dangerous clean up for anyone who wasn't a professional \
    with the right equipment and it was laying on top of what could be worse damage of the leach field. Not to \
    mention that if left to me to take care of it, it would be there for ages and the large hanging limbs \
    would be a threat all the while until they eventually fell at some other random unexpected moment. Plus, on \
    top of that, the reason this tree fell in the first place is because it was rotting; this was inevitable.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>So I hired a crew to take care of it. It took a team of five with heavy equipment eight hours to clear \
    it all up. They did a great job and I'm happy with the results.</p>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_220521c}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>I hope this kind of situation doesn't come up again any time soon though. There are trees much closer to \
    the house that also have rot and are on the side of the house that the bedrooms are on...</p>\

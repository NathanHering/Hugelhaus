    <h5>Wednesday February 23 2022</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>An earyly morning visit from a few deer.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I looked out the back window and saw five young deer grazing in my\
    yard. I thought that was pretty neat at first until I realized that they\
    couldn't find their way back out of the yard.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>They probably entered from the top of they yard where the fence meets\
    the house and I leave the gate open. After they had been there for at least\
    a few minutes, they seemed to be having a difficult time finding their way\
    back out.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>They were walking around the perimeter formed by the fence and didn't seem\
    willing or able to jump over it to get out. I decided to quietly walk outside\
    and guide them in the right direction by walking the opposite direction around\
    the yard toward them. This worked well enough for four of them. They bolted back\
    toward the entrance. One of them had a much harder time figuring it out.</p>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_220223}'></div>\
    <br>\
    <p>I decided at that point that I needed to clear some of the fence and open up\
    at least one section of it to allow animials an easier path through the yard. I \
    I want my yard to be a welcome place for wildelife.</p>\

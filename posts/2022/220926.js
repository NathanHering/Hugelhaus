    <h1>Back Yard Update</h1>\
    <h5>Monday September 26 2022</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>A little work at a time made a big difference.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I set out a few goals as far as yard work was concerned. I'll list \
    them below these 'before' pictures. These are all taken from \
    one position roughly in the middle of the yard. </p>\
    <br>\
    <h3>August 2021</h3>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_220926a}'></div>\
    <br>\
    <br>\
    <p>Here are the tasks I had on my list for the first year.</p><br>\
    <ul>\
    <li>Clear out some of the overgrowth by the fence to the west.</li><br>\
    <li>Remove the rusty cage and all the weeds etc around it.</li><br>\
    <li>Remove the fallen oak tree.</li><br>\
    <li>Clear out the weeds from around the trees at the north end of the yard.</li><br>\
    <li>Clear out the brush and crate by the gate.</li><br>\
    <li>Clean the burn pit and maybe build a landscaping stone wall around it.</li><br>\
    <li>Place mulch around the septic tank lids so I can start growing ground \
    cover in spring of 2023.</li><br>\
    <li>Remove the white fence by the garage.</li><br>\
    <li>Take down the satelite dishes.</li>\
    </ul>\
    <br>\
    <p>I may not have accomplished all the items on the list, but I did get a lot \
    done and the yard is definately starting to look a lot more like I envision for \
    the future. I also did a couple things with the front yard but I didn't document \
    them as well.</p>\
    <br><br>\
    <h3>September 2022</h3>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_220926b}'></div>\
    <br>\
    <p>Here's what I have in mind for next year.</p>\
    <br>\
    <ul>\
    <li>Remove the white fence by the garage. (from last year's list)</li><br>\
    <li>Take down the satelite dishes. (from last year's list)</li><br>\
    <li>Continue clearing out the weeds from around the trees at the north end of the \
    yard. I may leave only the trees I intend to harvest cuttings from.</li><br>\
    <li>Clear out the brush and weeds along the north fence and possibly the east and \
    west too.</li><br>\
    <li>I'm considering mulching along the north fence like I did with the septic tank lids.</li><br>\
    <li>Mulch around the leach field lids in the front yard.</li><br>\
    <li>Possibly build a decorative wooden fence by the leach field lids.</li><br>\
    <li>Start growing ground cover around the septic tank lids.</li><br>\
    <li>Clear out the growth around the fence at the south of the yard and mulch.</li><br>\
    </ul>\

    <h5>Tuesday June 21 2022</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>Now that the gate is clear, one of the deer came back.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>It was by chance that I looked out the window when I did and saw a \
    deer having some lunch; it then decided to take a nap. The interesting\
    thing about that is where it decided to nap. It seemed to find my deck to\
    be a good place to catch a bit of shut eye.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I attempted to get a picture of it by quietly sneaking around from the\
    front of the house, but it's hearing is too good apparently. I wasn't able\
    to get more than a few feet around the side of the house to get a picture\
    under the deck when it opened its eyes and dashed off.</p>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_220621}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>I told the story to my coworkers and made a game of giving this deer a\
    name. We arrived at Winkle. Partly because of the story Rip Van Winkle. I\
    shortened it to Winkle because it felt a little akward, kind of like a deer\
    that decides to walk right up to your house and relax.</p>\
    <br>
    <p>From this point on, the gate will be known as Winkle's gate.</p>

    <h1>Burn Pile Upgrade</h1>\
    <h5>Friday April 01 2022</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>The burn pile was a pretty high priority project.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Previously it didn't get a lot of use; either that or it just didn't get any attention \
    during yard upkeep. The pile was completely overgrown with weeds. Once I cleaned those out \
    I found a lot of stones, bricks, chunks of concrete, plastic parts, boards, logs, and random \
    metal parts embedded in the ground surrounding it and throughout.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I had initially been thinking of converting this back to yard and making a new burn pit \
    elswhere. However, once I got started on the clean up, I quickly found some challenges that \
    made me change my mind. The first issue was a lot of material that I could really only guess as \
    to what it was. It was crumbly and clay-like; I'm speculating was drywall. Considering the rest \
    of the stuff I found here, it seems like burning something with drywall wouldn't be surprising.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Also not surprising, but having much more of a deterrent effect on my plans, was the sharp \
    objects. There was a bit of broken glass in there, but there was a heck of a lot of nails, screws, \
    and other random sharp rusty metal. If I were to convert this to yard I would need to make sure \
    that no sharp object remained to puncture tires when mowing. That would have been a larger amount \
    of effort than I was interestd in putting into moving a burn pile. Instead I decided to build a \
    ring around the existing pit using landscaping stone. This would give me a barrier from the sharp \
    objects and would look nicer too.</p>\
    <br>\

    <br>\
    <p>Here's a before and after for reference. The work I did on the back fence gate makes a more \
    dramatic difference in the two images. But the improvement on the burn pile is still quite a nice \
    change just by itself.</p>\

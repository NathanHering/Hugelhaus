    <h1>New Lawnmower</h1>\
    <h5>Monday August 16 2021</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>I just want one thing that is reliable having bought a house full of projects.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Since there is nearly two acres of lawn to mow and I don't have a lawnmower, I decided to \
    buy a new one. I looked at a few different options. I was thinking of getting a zero turn \
    and my brother talked me out of it. He pointed out that when you turn on one of those, the \
    rear wheels are doing all the work like a tank. This would tear up my lawn anywhere the dirt \
    is moist. Since my yard abuts a wettlands, this didn't sound like a great option. Not to mention \
    I don't have many obstacles to manuver around. So, it's really not needed.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>It turns out the garden tracker variety of mower is quite a bit less expensive too. That gives \
    me the option to get a wider deck. Since I need something that'll handle that size lawn I got \
    something with a 54\" deck.</p>\
    <br>\

    <br>\
    <p>I ordered it online and got a call to coordinate the shipping a couple \
    days later. They said they'd have it to me on Monday and would call 30 minutes in advance of \
    delivery at my request.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>When I got a call from the driver, he was almost there already so I hurried up and headed over \
    to the house. He called me again just after I got there and told me he was driving a truck with a \
    40' trailer. There's no way that size trailer is going to make it down my little winding street. \
    It was a bust. He'd have to take the tractor back to the warehouse and have it loaded onto a smaller \
    truck to be delivered the next day.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>It's the next day and no call. I called the driver around 5pm to follow up and he told me \
    they sent him out on a different route. So, I figured I'd call the dispatch number and while looking \
    it up I saw that the delivery schedule had been updated on my tracking info. The new delivery time \
    was the following day between 9 and 11am.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I decided to just head over to my house at 8:30am and hang out there instead of waiting on a call. \
    This turned out to be a waist of time. It got to 11am and I called their dispatch and they said everything \
    looked fine for the expected window of delivery. I noticed that the area code for the dispatch was in \
    a time zone one hour behind me so that means it might be another hour.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I waited a few minutes, then called the driver again. He told me that they loaded the tractor first \
    in the truck so he would need to deliver a bunch of other stuff first in order to get to it. The shipping \
    company is SAIA by the way. Evidently they don't know that you can't deliver something when it's behind \
    everything else loaded on the trailer after it.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Around 2pm the driver calls to let me know he's getting close. I was out at the time so I headed back. \
    When I got there, he was pulling up near the yard and my neighbor was walking up the street toward him. \
    It turns out that they knew each other and the driver called my neighbor just before he got there. Small \
    world.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>The three of us proceeded to unload the tractor off the trailer and brought it up the drive on a pallet \
    jack. It was in a shipping crate that I broke apart while my neighgor and the driver caught up with each \
    other's lives. Then they helped me move it off the pallet and into my garage.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>It would be a few weeks before I actually fired it up for the first time. But I was looking forward to \
    mowing the lawn for the first time in my life. This looked like a really comfortable ride and it would be \
    exciting to know that I was mowing MY lawn, not my parents or my roomates and mine, but MY lawn.</p>\

    <p>I finally spend a night at the house.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I needed to test out using my phone as a hotspot for internet. And in order to \
    do that I really needed to spend a few hours at the house so I could gauge how consistent \
    the speeds were. Plus it was nice just to sleep in my own bed again and it gave me a \
    reason to test out the shower and hot water situation.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I got there around 5pm and the temperature outside was around 70° fahrenheit with a \
    low of 50° in the forecast. So, I bought a small space heater on the way over as well as \
    some kitchen items. I got my laptop set up for testing the tethering to my phone. And the \
    first test had to be to get some music going. I can't be hanging out in my house with no \
    music can I?</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>And now on to some more practical testing. I spent some time connected to my VM located \
    at the physical office location in Vancouver WA. That seemed to work pretty well. I streamed \
    some YouTube videos and they were working with no issue too.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I'd say it was a successful test overall. If I have to go a few months before Starlink \
    service, which will, hopefully free me up from using my phone for internet. Then I think I \
    will be able to get by. I'll have to make some habit changes to avoid using up my 15Gb limit \
    for hotspot data, but I think I can do it.</p>\

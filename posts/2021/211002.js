    <p>A litteral house warming gift and rust proofing the mower deck.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>My brother came by to deliver a very nice house warming gift that is very litteraly meant \
    to warm the house. He got me a ton of wood pellets. This was such a nice gesture and it helped \
    me get a sense of how long it would take to unload a pallet of them. I just ordered four tons \
    of the same brand and wasn't sure how much work it would be. We were able to unload them from \
    his truck in about 15 minutes.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>When they deliver the pellets they may be able to set them in the garage but I don't know \
    what kind of equipment they have for unloading them off of the truck. So they may end up leaving \
    them in the driveway for me to manually move them into the garage. I'm sure it will take me quite \
    a bit longer to move a ton by myself, but at least now I have an idea of what I should be prepared \
    for.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>While he was here, he helped me remove the mower deck from my new lawn tractor and coat all the \
    rust prone areas with fluid film. Once we finished with that, we connected the battery, added oil, 
    and fueled it up. Then we fired it up for a test run. I love it! The hydrostatic transmission is \
    so nice. And it can really move. I'm going to enjoy mowing the lawn instead of looking at is as a \
    chore.</p>\

    <h1>Utilities</h1>\
    <h5>Saturday August 14 2021</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>Now it's time to make my way through the utilities checklist.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p><b>Electric:</b> I already took care of that before I got the keys. The seller \
    let me know what day their service ended. So, I had mine turned on the day after that.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p><b>Garbage: </b>I called the garbage company that they had been using and \
    started an account with them. Nothing out of the ordinary there except that they had \
    two of the 96 gallon bins and the garbage company had no idea how or why.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p><b>Water and Sewer:</b> There's a well and septic on the property, so no need to get \
    service set up for those.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p><b>Internet:</b> This was more difficult than I had thought it would be.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I preordered Starlink a few weeks earlier but...</p>\
    <br>\
    <div class='img-caption'>\
        <img src='./images/2021/08/20210814_starlink.jpg'/ >\
        <div class='caption'>Starlink service is a whole other story for later.</div>\
    </div>\
    <br>\
    <p>I expected there to be service via land line phone wires that would be at least \
    enough to cover till Starlink service opened up. Starlink would be more than enough to \
    work from home with but I'll need something in the interim. I called AT&T, and they said \
    they don't have any service on my street better than around .5Mbps by .1Mbps. Which will \
    absolutely not work.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>So, the next thought was what the previous owners were using. I'm a Verison customer \
    already so Verison Home LTE makes sense. I got on their site to set up service and it \
    showed that they don't have service at my address. Really? That's what the previous \
    owners were using. Why would they say that it's not available where it is clearly available!</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I figured all I need to do is go to the Verison store and talk to someone in person. I'm \
    sure they have access to the system to get it set up. So, I went to the store and after waiting \
    45 minutes I got a turn to talk to the only rep who was working that day. And it only took him a \
    few minutes of digging to come up with the same negative result. He gave me a special phone \
    number to call.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I called the special number, it was supposed to bypass the phone tree but didn't, \
    and spoke with someone who tranfered me to someone else who put me on hold and \
    transfered me to another department where I got put on hold. Finally I got to talk to someone who \
    seemed like they knew what was going on. The story they gave me was this.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>The Home LTE service is geo-linked to the equipment from the previous account. People often \
    take the box when moving since it seems like a phone and connect anywhere. So, the assumption was \
    that the previous owners took the box and didn't turn off the service. All of this sounded like it \
    made some kind of sense at the time. He gave me his contact information with Verison and said if I \
    had a way to contact the previous owners that I could get ahold of him and finish setting me up \
    with the service.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I did in fact have the sellers info. They had given it to me before they moved out. So, I texted \
    him and asked him to turn off the service on his account so I could get mine turned on. His response \
    was that he changed his address and that was the last time he responded to my texts.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I tried calling the Verison agent and his voicemail inbox was full. Seriously? I texted multiple \
    times with no response. So frustrating that I gave up on Verison's Home LTE. UGH!</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>At this point I started calling every provider I could with the exception of HughesNet and ViaSat. \
    Those two have data caps that I thought would render their service useless after a few days of \
    online video meetings. What I found was that there was no provider that served my address.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I talked with a neighbor a few houses down and he told me that he used an AT&T version of Verison's \
    Home LTE. Unfortunately I got the same shut door on that as I did with Verison. Well, almost, I didn't \
    go through all the calls etc.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>At this point about all I could think to do was at least try out turning on the bluetooth tethering \
    (AKA Hotspot) feature on my phone service. I had done a series of speed tests from my phone and the \
    speeds would work. But, it remains to be seen as to whether that will be good enough to work from home. \
    I anticipate the speeds to fluctuate quite a bit and that may be problematic.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I'm preparing for a pretty serious adjustment in lifestyle if I can't get servicable internet.\

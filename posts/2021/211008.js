    <h1>Pellet Deleviery</h1>\
    <h5>Monday October 08 2021</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>I ordered five more tons of pellets.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>It took about five weeks from the time I placed the order before they \
    were able to deliver them. I spoke with the owner at JMJ who informed me that \
    they prioritize furnace installs over pellet orders. That makes sense, and \
    I wasn't in a big hurry anyway since I already had one ton.</p> \
    <br>\
    <p>When they delivered, it was the owner and an employee. The flat bed truck \
    had capacity for six tons so this was almost a full load. They had a pallet jack \
    and a portable fork-lift. They a pallet off the truck and were able to just barely \
    set it inside the garage. Then they used the jack to position it.</p> \

        <div class='caption'>This takes up nearly half of the garage. \
        Hopefully that will be more than enough to get me through the winter.</div>\

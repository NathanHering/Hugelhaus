    <h1>Stray Cat</h1>\
    <h5>Sunday December 12 2021</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>There is a stray cat that spends a lot of time around my house. I like cats.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>One day after having been out shoping or something, I came back home to discover a plastic bin. \
    wrapped in cellophane and stuffed with straw by my garage. In my experience, that's not a normal \
    thing to come home to. I was a bit startled and annoyed. Why had somone violated the sanctity of my \
    yard with this rather ugly fixture? Here I am trying to clean the trash out from this property and \
    now something showed up out of nowher. I hope random garbage appearing on my lawn wasn't something \
    I would have to figure out how to deal with living here.</p>\
    <br>
    <p>Okay, so this post has a note of neighborly influence. The next day after finding the random \
    plastic bin a neighbor stopped by and confessed to having placed it there. She admitted that she felt \
    this may have been inappropriate since she didn't discuss it with me in advance. I gently agreed \
    without accusing her of any wrong doing. Let's skip the rest of the details of the conversation and \
    just say that she took the box and left a large bag of cat food. The food was part of her plan too.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Let's back up for a moment. I had been feeding the stray cat already. I had food and water dishes \
    on the deck behind the house with a sheet of acrylic to help keep the food dry in the rain. Like I \
    said earlier, I like cats.</p>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_211212a}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>To be fair, I wasn't sure if I would go any further than this little effort until the neighbor \
    asked me to help it weather the winter. The plastic shelter she provided was out of the question \
    though. Which brings us to the project part of this post.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I decided to make a shelter for the cat that would help it keep warm and out of the wind during \
    the cold winter nights. I did this using mostly material that was around the house. The idea was to \
    make somehting that is well insulated, keeps the wind out and is small enough that the cat's body \
    heat would be enough to keep it cozy.</p>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_211212b}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>Before I can expect the cat to even try it out, I had some conditioning work to do. My intention \
    was to place the shelter on the back deck and up to this point the cat had been feed on the front \
    portch. So over the course of a week or two, I moved the food dish. Just a little at a time, I changed \
    the location each day and at the end, it knew where the new feeding place was.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>This brings us to the real test. Does the cat want anything to do with this shelter?</p>\
    <br>\
    <div class='slides' data-sources='${slides_211212c}'></div>
    <br>\
    <p>Well, the shelter passed a test but not the only test. It's interesting how, in my goal to help the \
    cat shelter from the snow, that my choice of location was the failure. Once there was a few inches \
    of snow, the cat didn't want to trudge throuh it to get to the deck in the back of the house. Not only \
    that, but it became evident that the portch was where it had been sheltering in the past. There was \
    enough room under there for it to hide and the wind was not a problem there.</p>\

    <h1>First Impressions</h1>\
    <h5>Saturday June 5 2021</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>It's 10AM on a Saturday and I'm taking my first look at the house in person.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I invited my sister and her husband to take a look at it with me. I'd like to get \
    their input instead of going it alone. We rode together and when we arrived, my realtor \
    was waiting for us. He had already made acquaintance with the sellers having arrived \
    a few minutes prior. They were still there too but were in their car and heading out \
    in order to give us time to tour the property.</p>\

    </div>\
    <br>\
    <p>Before we enter the house I note the quite of the road and the late-morning shade from \
    the trees in the front yard. The driveway is concrete with large cracks and \
    plenty of room for a few sedans. There's a two door garage, one has an automatic opener the \
    other is manual.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Why is there a large blue plastic drum container cut in half with dirt in it just outside \
    the garage? That wasn't in the picture.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>We walk through the open garage door to start the interior tour. There's a hook up for a \
    generator on one wall that ties in with a breaker box and has an external outlet on the east \
    side of the house. That'll come in handy and is great feature.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Overall the garage is not finished. The ceiling is in bad shape, there are patches of plastic \
    on the walls, and there is a door on the east that is covered from the interior. The floor also \
    has pretty large cracks.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>As we progressed through the house there was a running theme; needs fixed and has potential.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>In general I was most excited about the large open back yard and the unfinished basement. I \
    fully intend to beautify the back yard. And as for the basement, I'm hoping that in the next few \
    years I can add what will essentially be a day spa. I've always dreamed of having a steam room.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I could describe everything I saw during this initial walkthrough; the items that will need to be \
    fixed, the many ideas I have for improvements / changes, and the good times to be had here.</p>\
    <br>\
    </p>But that's what the rest of this blog is about...</p>\

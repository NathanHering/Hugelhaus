    <h1>Home Inspection</h1>\
    <h5>Saturday June 19 2021</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>The inspector's mother was in the hospital having just had a stroke a few days prior. \
    I appreciated his taking the time to take care of this during a stressful point in his life.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>He arrived just before I did and so did my agent. Before he got started he pointed \
    out that during the inspection he would let me know some of the items that can't be added \
    to the official report but were items he felt noteworthy. With that being said, he bagan \
    the inspection process.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>This took about two hours after he had anticipated it taking one. This was because of the \
    large number of items he found that he needed to report on. Let's just say the house is going \
    to be the source of many projects; some small and some not so small.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Ultimately there was nothing structurally wrong. There were just a lot of things that \
    needed attention. I intend on putting in the effort to give it that attention. I'm looking \
    forward to all the little steps as I make progress and make it my own.</p>\

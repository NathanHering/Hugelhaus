    <h1>House Warming</h1>\
    <h5>Monday September 6 2021</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>It's still up in the air as to when I will be able to start living in my house. \
    But that's no reason not to have friends over.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>On Memorial Day, my friends were nice enough to bring a picnic lunch, make it feel like \
    home, and spend time with me.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>When they arrived the first topic was that they were singing the address on the way over. \
    If only I had named the place earlier they could have sung Hugelhaus instead. At any rate, \
    when they arrived I gave them the tour of the house and yard and discussed the multitude of \
    small to medium issues that need to be fixed and looked forward to the amazing potential the \
    house and yard have.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>This was the first of what I hope will become a frequent occassion of hosting friends and family\
    and enjoying each other's company. Ah, looking forward to continuing to build memories at the \
    house.\
    </p>\

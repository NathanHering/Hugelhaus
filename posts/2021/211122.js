    <h1>Recycle Metal Items Left Behind</h1>\
    <h5>Monday November 22 2021</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>At least 700lbs of metal was left behind.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Between some items that were left in the house and things I dragged out of the \
    weeds at the edges of the lawn, there was a lot of recyclable metal. Since I didn't \
    have any use for any of these things, I asked my brother to help me take them to a \
    scrap yard where they would give me some money to recycle the metal.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>We loaded it up and it barely fit in his truck. The dry cleaner garment convery \
    components probably weighed the most out of all of it. It ended up weighing roughly \
    700 pounds and they gave my about $68 for it.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>There is still some stuff burried in the weeds that I can't get to until I start \
    cutting back the overgrowth. I'm not exactly sure it'll be enough to merit another \
    run to the recycle place. We'll see.</p>\

    <p>The previous owners took most of their stuff, but not all of it.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>When I was at the title company one of their employees told me that the sellers\
    were in the office the day before. The sellers said they were going to get rid of all \
    their old furniture. And the person from the title company told them they should \
    give it to me. She knew I was moving across the country with pretty much no furniture.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I didn't respond, but I was thinking NO!!! Their taste and mine don't \
    overlap at all. And then a few days later after the title signing I met the sellers at \
    the house and they said it again. \"Were planning on burning a lot of the old stuff \
    in a barn fire\". I said \"That sounds like fun\". I thought \"Who calls it a barn fire? \
    Doesn't he mean bon fire?\"</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Regardless of his plans there was quite a bit of stuf left behind. \
    They left some furniture, small appliances, all the curtains, and a lot of trash. \
    There were shards of wood from who knows what on the kitchen floor. I was going to have to \
    get rid off all of this myself. They even left me some pizza in the fridge so I could throw \
    that away for them too. How nice.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I spent a few hours going from room to room finishing collecting the random items \
    they left behind. I set a few things aside that might be useful, mostly free standing \
    wire shelving that was in pretty good shape. I put those in the basement and the rest \
    got sorted into the garage.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>The stuff I was not going to keep was enough to fill the whole two car garage. Some of \
    it will get donated, some recycled, and everything burnable... You guessed it, I'm going to \
    have a barn fire.</p>\

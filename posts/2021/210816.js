    <h1>Water Pressure</h1>\
    <h5>Monday August 16 2021</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>The original setup included two 20 gallon tanks connected in series. \
    The pressure would drop to near zero at just the flush of a toilet. \
    The well pump would kick on and the pressure would spike high enough \
    to turn it back off again almost immedietly. Which would let the pressure \
    drop low enough to trigger the pump to start again. This would repeat \
    several times until eventually the tanks were full.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>The issue was that the tanks were both full mostly of sediment. The filter \
    for the system is in place after the water tanks so the water from the well \
    can settle debris in the tank before it gets filtered. Over time they were very \
    clogged and were basically useless.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>My brother and I replaced the two 20 gallon tanks with one 32 gallon tank. Going \
    forward I will be purging it periodically, possibly monthly, to keep it \
    from filling up with sediment. I may change the system so that the water routes \
    through the filter prior to the tank in the future.</p>\

        <div class='caption'>Laden with sediment, the two original tanks lay uselessly to the right \
        while the new tank takes their place. Maybe the new tank will get an improved water treatment \
        system to go with it.</div>\

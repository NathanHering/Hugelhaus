    <h1>The Keys</h1>\
    <h5>Monday August 9 2021</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>Late afternoon and I'm meeting my realtor to hand over the keys.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>This got a bit of a later start than we anticipated. My realtor's vehicle had problems \
    and he wound up stuck for the better part of the day. None the less, we were able to \
    meet at the house around 5pm. He handed over the keys and that was that. I'm now officialy \
    able to take up residence in my new home.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>But that wouldn't actually be taking place for a while. I'm not even sure how long at this \
    point. I still need to iron out the details of getting internet service and handle a couple \
    other items with my family first.</p>\

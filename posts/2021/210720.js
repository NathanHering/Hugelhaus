    <h5>Monday July 26 2021</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>Everything is in order, time to sign the title.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>There were some tense moments a couple days ago. Some last minute details hinged \
    on someone else signing paperwork and it was a bit of a close call. But, \
    it all worked out and now I can sign with the title company.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>This important event went more smoothly than getting all the other details taken care \
    of. I only ended up spending about an hour signing all the many documents with the title \
    companies notary. Once that was taken care of they would notify the sellers and we can \
    move on to the next phase.</p>\

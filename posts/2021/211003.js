    <p>There is a wasps nest in the burn pile.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I'd like to be able to mow the lawn, but first I should try to get rid of \
    the wasps. Since it was raining today, I wasn't going to mow anyway. So, I put 
    some cardboard on the burn pile and put the dogwood brush on top of that. I threw 
    a flare on it to get it burning. Then I carefully pulled a pallet from the wet \
    side of the burn pile. That's where the wasps were.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I think because the temperature was a bit cooler today they weren't as easliy \
    stired. The fire was starting to catch pretty well and I managed to get the pallet \
    on top of the fire. This helped channel the air toward the fire and actually helped \
    focus the heat on the wet pallet.</p>\

        <div class='caption'>The first time I've had a fire in the burn pile.</div>\
    </div>\
    <br>\
    <p>Unfortunately, despite the smoke and the heat, the wasps were still buzzing around. \
    Fortunately, they didn't notice or attack me. That actually happened a couple weeks ago \
    and it sucked. I was trying to clean up the burn pile and when I moved a pallet, they \
    attacked me. I think their nest must be underground. So, I think I'll wait till it's \
    cold outside and get a good ripping fire going directly on the spot where I think their \
    nest is.</p>\

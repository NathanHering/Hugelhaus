    <h1>What Feels Like Home?</h1>\
    <h5>Sunday September 12 2021</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>It's been over a month now that I've had the keys to the house and it doesn't feel like home yet.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Between trying to figure out how I'm going to solve the internet issue and staying with my mom so she \
    won't be alone; I haven't had a chance to actually move in. It's probably just as well though. There are \
    a few bigger items that need to be taken care of before the house is comfortable enough to live in.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>Still I would like the house to at least feel like it's my home and that wasn't the case until today. \
    I brought over my comforter that I've had for a quite a few years. It's light brown micro-suede and I \
    really like it. When I put it on my bed, that was the first moment when the house started to feel like home.</p>\

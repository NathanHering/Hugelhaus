    <h1>Another Burn</h1>\
    <h5>Wednesday November 17 2021</h5>\
    <br>\
    <p>Time to get rid of some of the burnable items the previous owners left behind.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I gathered up about half of the items left behind as well as some of the growth I had \
    trimmed around the yard. There was a chair, a few table leaves, a couple small end tables, 
    and some miscellaneous wood items. I added some cardboard into the mix and lit it up.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I was also trying to burn up some of the chunks of wood left in the burn pit as the fire \
    grew. I added them to the top of the pile. There are still some left to burn but it's better \
    now.</p>\

        <div class='caption'>The fire burned for a few hours.</div>\
    </div>\
    <br>\
    <p>Once I'm done burning the remaining fuel there will be some additional clean up to do. There \
    is a lot of small metal parts, like wire mesh and nails, etc in the ashes. There is also some kind \
    of material that I'm not sure what it is; I'm guessing it's burned drywall that's disolved from the \
    heat and soaking up water in the weather. That will all need to be dug out and disposed of before \
    this will be a nicer looking fire pit.</p>\
    <br>\
    <p>I may also just decide to move the fire pit entirely. It is pretty far from the house. This may be \
    a better place for a burn barrel. Something that isn't for socializing and instead have a fire pit a \
    little closer to the house.</p>\
